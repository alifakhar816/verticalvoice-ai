/**
 * Streams a voice's sample clip to the browser.
 *
 * This proxy exists for one concrete reason: Ultravox's `previewUrl` points at
 * a public Google Cloud Storage object that is served with
 * `content-type: text/plain`. Browsers refuse to decode that in an `<audio>`
 * element, so handing the raw URL to the client produces a silent, broken play
 * button. Re-serving the same bytes under `audio/mpeg` fixes it.
 *
 * Authenticated for the same reason the list route is: the catalog is bought
 * with our Ultravox key. The upstream fetch is unauthenticated by design — the
 * storage URL is public and needs no API key.
